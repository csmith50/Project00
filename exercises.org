** TODO WDT
  PVP the result of evaluating the following (paying special attention to the
  more-than-syntactic difference between the \lsquo{}starless\rsquo{} form of =let= and the
  \lsquo{}star-suffixed\rsquo{} form):

This will output 6.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) (+ a b c))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6
Indeed it did. It sets the variables a, b, and c and then adds them together.

This will not run. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) (+ a b c d))
#+END_SRC
Cannot run d is void it says. This is because we are telling it to add a variable called d but we have not defined
such a variable.

This also will not run.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)) [+ a b c d])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [+ a b c d]
It appears that it defined a set which includes + a, b, c, and d. The brackets define a set where parenthesis
define a statement.

This will output 4 then 6.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3) (+ 4)) (+ a b c +))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 10
It outputted 10 because it defined the + symbol as a variable which is then set to 4. So it added together 1, 2, 3, and 4
resulting in 10.

This will return 11.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (makunbound 'a)
  (let ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3) (d (+ a 4))) (+ a b c d))
#+END_SRC
Doesn't run. a is void. makunbound thus must mean that it deletes the variables provided in the parameters.

This will return 11.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let* ((a 1) (b 2) (c 3) (d (+ a 4))) (+ a b c d))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 11
Indeed it does. d is set to the expression of 1 + 4 meaning 5. It then adds together 1, 2, 3, and 5 resulting in 11.

    See above.

** TODO TEJ
  A function-as-association between elements of a domain and elements of a
  codomain, for \ldquo{}small\rdquo domains and codomains, inspired so-called \ldquo{}association
  lists\rdquo (or alists) and the =assoc= (and associated) functions.

  =(assoc KEY LIST)= returns non-nil if KEY is \ldquo{}equal\rdquo to the first element of
  an element of LIST. The value is actually the first element of LIST whose
  first element equals KEY.

  For example, here is a function that uses an alist to look up the RGB values
  of a given color name:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun lookup-rgb (color-name)
    (rest (assoc color-name
                 '(("red" 255 0 0) ("green" 0 255 0) ("blue" 0 0 255)))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (lookup-rgb "blue")
#+END_SRC

: (0 0 255)

  What if the color name is not in the alist?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (lookup-rgb "grue")
#+END_SRC

: nil

  There are several variations of =assoc=. Find and give examples of using them.

*** Your answer goes here.
     There is a C++ STL data structure called maps which implement this idea. You use this if you want a quick way to 
     access key-value pairs. Such as when storing student's grades. Each student gets their own key and the grade
     is stored in an array which maps to that particular student's key.

     Another example could be using a switch statement to determine which value to return in a function.
     The key is entered and goes into the switch statement. Then the switch statement can return the corresponding
     value.

** TODO WFK
  In the function-as-map context, here is another interpretation:

  A \ldquo{}map\rdquo type (AKA associative array, AKA hashtable) is found in many
  languages. For example, C++:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :results output
  #include <iostream>
  #include <map>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
     map<string, string> mymap;

     mymap["one"] = "red";
     mymap["two"] = "blue";
     mymap["three"] = "green";

     for (auto const &ent1 : mymap) {
        cout << ent1.first << " : " << ent1.second << endl;
     }
  }
#+END_SRC

: one : red
: three : green
: two : blue

  And python:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
  mymap = {}

  mymap["one"] = "red"
  mymap["two"] = "blue"
  mymap["three"] = "green"

  if __name__ == "__main__":
          for key in mymap.keys():
                  print key + " : " + str(mymap[key])
#+END_SRC

: three : green
: two : blue
: one : red

  And of course elisp:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output
  (let* ((mymap (make-hash-table)))
    (puthash "one" "red" mymap)
    (puthash "two" "blue" mymap)
    (puthash "three" "green" mymap)
    (pp (list (gethash "one" mymap)
              (gethash "two" mymap)
              (gethash "three" mymap)))
    (maphash (lambda (key value) (princ (format "%s : %s\n" key value))) mymap))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (nil nil nil)
: one : red
: two : blue
: three : green

: ("red" "blue" "green")
: one : red
: two : blue
: three : green

  What happens if you omit the =:test 'equal= parameters to the
  =make-hash-table= call?
  
*** Your answer goes here.
    The variable is then no longer defined as a map and when you call puthash the function doesn't know how to respond
    and simply returns nil instead.


** TODO TER
  This exercise explores /looping/ versus /mapping/.

  What does the =morphify= function defined below do? Think about it, then PVP
  the result of the call to it that follows.

This will run each piece of the code in the list. It will then put the results in a list.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun morphify (fun lst)
    (loop for item in lst
          collect (funcall fun item)))
#+END_SRC

  Note the quotes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (morphify (quote downcase) (quote ("THIS" "IS" "TOO" "LOUD")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
(this is too loud)
So it lowercased each string in the list. So we passed it a function and a list of elements. It then ran that function
and passed it each of the elements that we passed to morphify.

  The =morphify= function is essentially a /mapping/ function, which means it
  takes a passed-in function (=fun=) and a passed-in list (=lst=), and /maps fun
  over lst/, i.e., the results of calling the function =fun= on each element of
  the list =lst= are collected into a new list, which is returned.

  This shows one way (iteratively) a /map/ function could be implemented.
  Another way is /recursively/, as in:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun morphifyr (fun lst)
    (if (null lst)
        nil
      (append (list (funcall fun (first lst))) (morphifyr fun (rest lst)))))
#+END_SRC

  Explain how this version of =morphify= works.
  
*** Your answer goes here.
    It recursively does the same thing as above. First it defeins an exit case where our list of arguments is null. 
    Once this is hit it exists the recursive function. If our list is not null then it calls the function in fun and passes it the first
    item in our list of arguments and appends that to a list. It then calls morphifyr again except with the first element taken off 
    our list of arguments.

** TODO TGE
  Note the difference if -13 is used instead of 13 below:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
  (defun compute-floor-the-hard-way (dividend divisor)
    (- (/ dividend (float divisor)) (/ (mod dividend divisor) (float divisor))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
  (let* ((number (/ -13 4.0))
         (floor1 (floor number))
         (floor2 (compute-floor-the-hard-way -13 4.0)))
    (list number floor1 floor2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
(-3.25 -4 -4.0)

: (3.25 3 3.0)

  Is the hard way correct?
  
*** Your answer goes here.
    Yes. 3.25 rounded down is 3. -3.25 rounded down is 4.

** TODO THP
  Graph the floor and ceiling functions f(x) = \lfloor{}x\rfloor and f(x) = \lceil{}x\rceil for real
  number values of x in the interval [-5.0 .. 5.0].
  
*** Your answer goes here.
      Number | Floor | Ceiling
    

** TODO WKM
  Which of these statements about floor and ceiling are correct, for any real
  number $x$ and any integers $n$ and $m$?
  1. $x - 1 < \lfloor{}x\rfloor \le x \le \lceil{}x\rceil < x + 1$.
  2. $\lfloor{}-x\rfloor = -\lceil{}x\rceil$.
  3. $\lceil{}-x\rceil = -\lfloor{}x\rfloor$.
  4. $\lfloor{}x + n\rfloor = \lfloor{}x\rfloor + n$.
  5. $\lceil{}x + n\rceil = \lceil{}x\rceil + n$.
  6. $\lfloor{}\frac{n}{2}\rfloor + \lceil{}\frac{n}{2}\rceil = n$.
  7. $\lfloor{}\frac{n}{2}\rfloor + \lfloor{}\frac{n + 1}{2}\rfloor = n$.
  8. $\lceil{}\frac{n}{2}\rceil + \lceil{}\frac{n + 1}{2}\rceil = n$.
  9. $\lfloor{}\frac{n + m}{2}\rfloor + \lceil{}\frac{n - m + 1}{2}\rceil = n$ (for any $m$, not just $m =
     0$ as in statement 7).
  10. $\lceil{}\frac{n + m}{2}\rceil + \lceil{}\frac{n - m + 1}{2}\rceil = n$ (for any $m$, not just $m =
      0$ as in statement 8).

** TODO TIW

  Define the function \ldquo{}round to nearest integer\rdquo using the floor and ceiling
  functions, together with the \ldquo{}Iverson bracket\rdquo function. (A number whose
  fractional part is less than one-half should be rounded down, otherwise up.)
